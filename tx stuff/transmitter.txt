channels have mixing added to them

default is 100% mixing from a single input with normal direction with a one to one mapping from these inputs:


ch1 steering
ch2 throttle
ch3 stick h
ch4 stick v
ch5 pot 1
ch6 pot 2
ch7 sw 1
ch8 sw 2


sw 1 and sw 2 are three position switches, sw 3 and sw 4 are two position switches

this leaves sw 3 and sw 4 unassigned

you can edit, remove and add mixes to any channel using the mixing screen available for each channel.

the two primary screens are channels and inputs. additional screens include telemetry and calibration.

inputs will only display the inputs assigned to channels via mixes.

input names can be edited.

primary screen on power up is the inputs screen.

to adjust center position for any channel, as well as end points, use the individual channel
screen for editing a specific channel.

there are 4 total trims, steering, throttle, and thumb stick (h & v) by default.

trim switches can be moved to other channels if desired.

trim switches can be used as inputs if desired.

press center buttons to change trim buttons to editing buttons.

8 * 6 == 48 bytes of calibration data




each model:

trim3
trim4
10 + 2 + 2 + 8  == 22 bytes
